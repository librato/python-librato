python-librato
==============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/librato/python-librato.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/librato/python-librato)

A Python wrapper for the Librato Metrics API.

## Installation

In your shell:

  ```$ easy_install librato-metrics```

  or

  ```$ pip install librato-metrics```

From your application or script:

  ```import  librato```

## Authenticating

  We first use our credentials to connect to the API.  I am assuming you have
[a librato account for Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com/). Go to your
[account settings page](https://metrics.librato.com/account) and save your
username and token.

```
  api = librato.connect(user, token)
```

## Basic Usage

To iterate over your metrics:

```
  for m in api.list_metrics():
    print m.name
```

Let's now create a Metric:

```
  api.submit("temperature", 10, description="temperature at home")
```

By default ```submit()``` will create a gauge metric. The metric will be
created automatically by the server if it does not exist. We can remove it:

```
  api.delete("temperature")
```

For creating a counter metric, we can:

```
  api.submit("connections", 20, type='counter', description="server connections")
```

And again to remove:

```
  api.delete("connections")
```

To iterate over your metrics:

```
  for m in api.list_metrics():
    print "%s: %s" % (m.name, m.description)
```

To retrieve a specific metric:

```
  gauge   = api.get("temperature")
  counter = api.get("connections")
```

For sending more measurements:

```
  for temp in [20, 21, 22]:
    api.submit('temperature', temp)
  for num_con in [100, 200, 300]:
    api.submit('connections', num_con, type='counter')
```

Let's now iterate over the measurements of our Metrics:

```
  metric = api.get("temperature", count=100, resolution=1)
  for m in metric.measurements['unassigned']:
    print "%s: %s" % (m['value'], m['measure_time'])
```

Notice a couple of things here. First, we are using the key `unassigned` since
we have not associated our measurements to any source. Read more about it in
the [API documentation](http://dev.librato.com/v1). In addition, notice how
we are passing the count and resolution parameters to make sure the API
returns measurements in its answer and not only the metric properties.
Read more about them [here](http://dev.librato.com/v1/time-intervals).

## Sending measurements in batch mode

Sending a measurement in a single HTTP request is inefficient. The overhead
both at protocol and backend level is very high. That's why we provide an
alternative method to submit your measurements. The idea is to send measurements
in batch mode. We push measurements that are stored and when we are
ready, they will be submitted in an efficient matter. Here is an example:

```
api = librato.connect(user, token)
q   = api.new_queue()
q.add('temperature', 22.1, source='upstairs')
q.add('temperature', 23.1, source='dowstairs')
q.add('num_requests', 100, type='counter', source='server1')
q.add('num_requests', 102, type='counter', source='server2')
q.submit()
```

## Updating Metrics

You can update the information for a metric by using the `update` method,
for example:

```
api = librato.connect(user, token)
for metric in api.list_metrics():
    gauge = api.get(m.name)
    attrs = gauge.attributes
    attrs['display_units_long'] = 'ms'
    api.update(metric.name, attributes=attrs)
```

The original version of `python-librato` was conceived/authored/released by Chris Moyer (AKA [@kopertop](https://github.com/kopertop)). He's
graciously handed over maintainership of the project to us and we're super-appreciative of his efforts.
