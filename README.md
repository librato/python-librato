[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/librato/python-librato.png?token=5DkaEcPsGmzNFtrdssjk)](http://magnum.travis-ci.com/librato/python-librato)

A Python wrapper for the Librato Metrics API.

## Installation

In your shell:

  ```$ easy_install librato-python```

  or

  ```$ pip install librato-python```

From your application or script:

  ```import  librato```

## Authenticating

  The first thing we to is preseting the credentials so we have access to the
  metrics api. I am assuming you have
  [a librato account for Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com/). Go to your
  [account settings page](https://metrics.librato.com/account)
  and save your username and token.

```
  api = librato.connect(user, token)
```

## Basic Usage

To iterate over your metrics:

```
  for m in api.list_metrics():
    print m.name
```

Let's now create a Gauge Metric:

```
  gauge = api.create_gauge("temperature", description="temperature at home")
```

And we can remove using:

```
  api.delete_gauge("temperature")
```

And for counter metrics:

```
  counter = api.create_counter("connections", description="server connections")
  api.delete_counter("connections")
```

To iterate over your metrics:

```
  for m in api.list_metrics():
    print "%s: %s" % (m.name, m.description)
```

To retrieve a concrete gauge or counter:

```
  gauge   = api.get_gauge("temperature")
  counter = api.get_counter("connections")
```

Now, let's send some data to our metrics:

```
  for temp in [20, 21, 22]:
    api.send_gauge_value('temperature', temp)
```

and for our connections (a counter metric):

```
  for num_con in [100, 200, 300]:
    api.send_counter_value('connections', num_con)
```

Let's now iterate over the measurements of our Metrics:

```
  measurements = api.get_gauge("temperature", resolution=1, count=10).measurements
  for m in measurements['unassigned']:
    print "%s: %s" % (m['value'], m['measure_time'])
```

```
  measurements = api.get_counter("connections", resolution=1, count=10).measurements
  for m in measurements['unassigned']:
    print "%s: %s" % (m['value'], m['measure_time'])
```

Notice how we are using the key `unassigned` since we have not associated our
measurements to any source. Read more about it in the
[API documentation](http://dev.librato.com/v1).
